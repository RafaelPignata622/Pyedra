# Datasets
Here is a description of the data used in Pyedra's main module as well as in the tests.

--------------------------------------------------
## `penttila2016.csv`
For the adjustment of the phase function H-G1-G2 the tabulated values of the base functions presented in Penttila et. al (2016) were used.

> A. Penttil ̈a,  V. G. Shevchenko, O. Wilkman, & K. Muinonen (2016). H,G1, G2photometric phase function
> extended to low-accuracy data. 123:117–125.

--------------------------------------------------
##  `carbognani2019.csv`
This dataset consists of the phase angles and V magnitudes observed by Carbognani et. al (2019). These data are used as input to perform the tests. 

> Carbognani, A., Cellino, A., & Caminiti, S. (2019). New phase-magnitude curves for some main belt asteroids, 
> fit of different photometric systems and calibration of the albedo-Photometry relation. 
> Planetary and Space Science, 169, 15-34.
